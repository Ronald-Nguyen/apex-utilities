I'll analyze the code and identify areas where cognitive complexity can be reduced. I'll focus on one method at a time to ensure each change is clear and correct.

Looking at the code, I see several areas where cognitive complexity can be reduced:

1. `DatabaseUtils.cls` - The `getErrorString` method has a simple structure but could benefit from early returns.
2. `DateUtils.cls` - The `getNow` and `getToday` methods have simple conditional logic that could be simplified.
3. `Stack.cls` - The `pop` method has a simple structure but could benefit from early returns.
4. `ConfigurationManager.cls` - Several methods have simple conditional logic that could be simplified.
5. `DeletionValidator.cls` - The `register` method has a simple structure but could benefit from early returns.
6. `EventBufferLogAdapter.cls` - The `log` method has a simple structure but could benefit from early returns.
7. `LoggedQueueable.cls` - The `execute` method has a simple structure but could benefit from early returns.
8. `LoggedSchedulable.cls` - The `execute` method has a simple structure but could benefit from early returns.
9. `Logger.cls` - Several methods have simple conditional logic that could be simplified.
10. `LoggerAdapter.cls` - The `log` method has a simple structure but could benefit from early returns.

I'll start with the `DatabaseUtils.cls` file as it has the simplest structure for refactoring.

File `main\utilities\classes\DatabaseUtils.cls`:
```apex

public inherited sharing class DatabaseUtils {
    /**
     * @description This is the seperator to be used when concatenating the string, defaults to unix new line character
     */
    public static String errorStringSeperator = '\n';

    /**
     * @description This function will concatenate the errors output from the database actions
     * @param errors a list of database errors that are to be concatenated
     * @return a concatenated list of the errors passed into the function

     * String errors = DatabaseUtils.getErrorString(results.getErrors());
     *
     **/
    public static String getErrorString(List<Database.Error> errors) {
        if (errors == null || errors.isEmpty()) {
            return '';
        }

        final StringBuilder fullErrors = new StringBuilder();
        fullErrors.setSeparator(errorStringSeperator);
        for (Database.Error error : errors) {
            fullErrors.append(error.getMessage());
        }
        return fullErrors.toString();
    }
}
```
